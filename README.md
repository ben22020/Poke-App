PokeApp is designed for the use of Pokemon trading card fans who wish to find rare cards to trade as well as keep track of those that are gaining or losing popularity. The app provides users with a way to track their own Pokemon card collection, as well as view what cards other users have available for trade. Users may initiate to trade for a card in their collection, marking it as tradeable and allowing it to appear on the homepage for other users. Other users may offer to trade for one of their cards in return. Trades are accepted or rejected. Users may also view the recent history of traded cards, which gives users an idea of which cards are in demand at the time. Each user is able to sign up or log in to the Angular SPA through Auth0. Logic and data are managed by a REST API which integrates to the SQLServer database with entity framework.
